Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling having fun
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue
Like I always do
Because somewhere in the crowd theres you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I am thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I am going crazy
But its gonna be alright 
You will soon be changing everything
Everything will be so different
When I am on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling having fun
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I wont feel blue
Like I always
